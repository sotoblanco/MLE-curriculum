# Learning Principles

This is an optional section, and is the core principles of this curriculum. We use world-wide class resources to provide the best learning experience, and we also use the best practices to learn, to achieve the best results.

## [Barabar Oakley](https://barbaraoakley.com/books/)

- **Pomodoro Technique**: 25 minutes of focused work, 5 minutes break. After 4 cycles, take a longer break.

- **Diffuse mode**: When you are stuck, take a break, do something else (workout is great thing to do), and let your brain work in the background.

- **Active study**: when learning is important to retrieve from your long term memory and test your-self to evaluate how well you are doing.

> So for those who actually want to learn. Unless you are trying to learn something narrow and specific, close those tabs with quick blog posts. Close those tabs of "Learn XYZ in 10 minutes". Consider the opportunity cost of snacking and seek the meal - the textbooks, docs, papers, manuals, longform. Allocate a 4 hour window. Don't just read, take notes, re-read, re-phrase, process, manipulate, learn.
