# Machin Learning Enginneer Curriculum

The MLE curriculum is built thinking about the skills needed to get the initial interview, but also to pass and succeed in the job. We will analyze different companies from MANGA to start-up and even sports team, we will learn the requirements and how to match a job description and being confident in the skill set. 

All content is taken from different resources that has proven results for a lot of people from landing dream job to succesfull entrepeneurs. 

The curriculum is structured in three phases in which you will learn the skills needed, we focus similar skill at the same time, the amount of hours to commit depends on your needs, but overall it required at least 2 hours at day.

## First phase

- Data enginnering & SQL
- Python
- Data structures and algorithms
- Deep learning for coders

This first phase is intended to provided the building blocks of the material you need, and also the learning principles, data structures and algorithms is going at every phase, no matter how good you become, to get a job you need to pass the interviews, so it is required to have an intensive knowledge, python skills will also be a critical feature for all the curriculum, if you donâ€™t understand python code is difficult to communicate with other developer.

We'll be using the core principles of learning how to learn, for this we use the pomodoro technique, available as a free app called [pomofocus](https://pomofocus.io/), the principle is taking 25 minutes of intense work removing any distraction and 5 minutes off, this help you to stay focus and have some tracking metric system that we incorporate into our leaderboard. 

### Data engineering

We will be using the book [Foundamental of data engineering](https://learning.oreilly.com/library/view/fundamentals-of-data/9781098108298/) by Joe Reis, is one of the best book to learn it and a course about data engineering.

### SQL

I like the [SQL skill path of dataquest](https://www.dataquest.io/path/sql-skills/) since provides a hands-on experience in how to build this queries. We can also work with [CS50 SQL](https://cs50.harvard.edu/sql/2024/) to have a free resource at hand.

### Data structures and algorithm

We will use the [neetcode](https://neetcode.io/courses) course, and the [CS50](https://cs50.harvard.edu/college/2024/fall/syllabus/) only from week 2 to 5.

### Python

We need to understand our language for several reasons, first to work smoothly through python features, being able to read and understand code, and also explain and share good quality of code. For this we will be using [CS50's Introduction to Programming with Python (harvard.edu)](https://cs50.harvard.edu/python/2022/), also python for coding interviews [Problems (neetcode.io)](https://neetcode.io/problems/python-sort-ascending) and [Fluent Python, 2nd Edition (oreilly.com)](https://learning.oreilly.com/library/view/fluent-python-2nd/9781492056348/) 

### Deep learning for coders

[Practical Deep Learning for Coders - Practical Deep Learning (fast.ai)](https://course.fast.ai/) will help you to stay on track, building top performing ML models from the initial phase, we will spent time evaluating the lectures, practical exercise and projects. Since this is the big why are we here, everything else helps to this purpose.
