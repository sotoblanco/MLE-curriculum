# 1st week MLE-Curriculum (Questions)

This is the first homework of our MLE-curriculum, the idea is to follow a path that help us answer the questions of the first week. The approach we are taking is having a curriculum in which you will build your skills in different areas at the same time by following the proposal calendar

| Monday | Tuesday | Wednesday | Thursday | Friday | Saturday |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Data engineering | SQL | Data structures and algorithms | Deep learning for coders | Data structures and algorithms | Data engineering |

## Data engineering

**Data engineering**: Read the first chapter of the Joe Reis book and answer the following questions

**1. What is the primary focus of data engineering, according to the book?**

a) Designing visually appealing data visualizations
b) Building and maintaining the infrastructure for data collection, storage, and processing
c) Developing machine learning models for predictive analytics
d) Conducting in-depth statistical analysis on large datasets

**2. Which of the following is NOT a core responsibility of a data engineer?**

a) Data ingestion from various sources
b) Data cleaning and transformation
c) Data modeling and schema design
d) Developing user interfaces for data visualization

**3. What is the role of "pipelines" in data engineering?**

a) Physical conduits for transferring large volumes of data
b) Automated workflows for data processing and movement
c) Storage solutions for unstructured data
d) Communication channels between data engineers and data scientists

## SQL

1. List the names and data types for the "products" table to answer what’s the type of productLine column

1. Query for relevant columns for productLine, MSRP, quantityInStock and buyPrice and limit your query to the first 10 elements, what’s the buyPrice of the last value in the products table

1. Write a query that classifies the products in out of stock, low stock and in stock, the cut-off points for out of stock is 0, low stock is less than 1000, and in stock over 1000, select the prdoucts with less than 1000 products and limit your query to 10 observations, what’s the quantityInStock of the first product that returns your query

## DSA

Solve the two sum problem on leetcode

1. What’s the data structure used to solve this problem?

[Two Sum - LeetCode](https://leetcode.com/problems/two-sum/description/)

## Deep learning for coders

1. Follow the tutorials of deep learning for coders and share the link to a notebook that trains a model based on a different dataset with similar approach to one of the videos
